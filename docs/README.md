# Hands-on DSP exercises for COM-303 at EPFL

In this `gitbook`, we provide step-by-step instructions for the hands-on exercises of the EPFL course: [Signal processing for communications](http://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=24007074&ww_x_anneeacad=1866893861&ww_i_section=944590&ww_i_niveau=6683147&ww_c_langue=fr). The purpose of these exercises is to provide first-hand experience (and valuable struggles) in the practical sides of Digital Signal Processing (DSP).

Working with hardware can often be frustrating and overwhelming with the numerous protocols, lengthy documentations, and seemingly competing components. With these exercises, we hope to ease you into the fun and exciting side of DSP!

If you are coming from another institution, feel free to use the material from these exercises and let us know if you spot any points for improvement!
